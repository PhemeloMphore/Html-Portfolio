<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Phemelo Mphore, a 23-year-old Scorpio and certified Digital Marketer. My interest in marketing first began when I obtained my initial certification in digital marketing from Google. I then furthered my education by enrolling in the Digital Marketing Course at the University of Cape Town (UCT), where I excelled. My pursuit of becoming a fully qualified marketer didn't stop there, as I later upscaled my skills by completing another course with HubSpot Academy.</p>
<p>So, basically, getting into software development was a natural progression.</p>
