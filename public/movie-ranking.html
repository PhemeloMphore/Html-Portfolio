<h1>The Greatest Movies Of All Time By Phemelo Mphore</h1>
<h2>This is a list of all my favourite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>This is honestly the best Musical ever made! From the casting, to that acting! everything was pure perfection! Let's not even get into the movie's incredible soundtrack! Chart-topping!</p>
<h3>2. Avatar</h3>
<p>Not only is this movie incredible! The fact that it was made in 2009 with its groundbreaking CGI?? This Sci-Fi space new world movie was just marvoulous. The storytelling and direction that the movie followed, had me obsessed with this movie for almost 2 decades now.</p>
<h3>3. Moana</h3>
<p>This animated movie by Disney was one of their best works since their Golden Age of the 1900's. This movie had me infront of my screen every after school. I could'nt get enough! What a beautiful story this was! The soundtrack for this movie was honeslty, chart-topping hits!</p>
